# Simulation-of-Microwave-Waveguide-Characteristics-using-MATLAB
The Project involves the simulation of high power, low loss microwave waveguide (Circular, Tapered Waveguide) characteristics. 
(Feb 2018 - May 2018)

A waveguide consists of a hollow metallic tube of rectangular or circular shape used to guide electromagnetic waves. Waveguides are used principally at frequencies in the microwave range. In waveguides the electric and magnetic fields are confined to the space within the guides which causes minimum loss. The waves propagate in the waveguide in several modes (TE or TM). The aim of the project is to increase the bandwidth-gain product by considering alternative waveguide such as tapered structure and comparing with the standard waveguide structures.
